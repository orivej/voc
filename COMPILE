Platforms
=======:
several bootstrap static binaries provided, for

gnu/linux on x86_64
gnu/linux on x86
gnu/linux on armv6j_hardfp (i. e. raspberry pi)
darwin on x86_64 (read osx)
freebsd on x86_64
openbsd on x86_64

Prerequisites:
==========
on Debian GNU/Linux:

gcc, libc6-dev on debian

on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:

gcc, glibc-devel, glibc-static

on OSX:
clang, Xcode.

How to install
==============

By default, voc will be installed to /opt/voc-<version> and /opt/voc symlink to it will be created.
If you want it in other prefix, then edit makefile for your platform, and change PRF = "/opt" to the path you need.

Then just cd into source directory and type

>make -f makefile.linux.gcc.x86_64

if you are on GNU/Linux x86_64 platform and you want voc to use gcc as backend.

otherwise use corresponding makefile.

Note for FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OSX users:
use gmake instead of make, i. e.

>gmake -f makefile.darwin.clang.x86_64

then type

>sudo make install

or
>sudo gmake -f makefile.darwin.clang.x86_64 install

on MacOSX/Darwin.

build rpm
=========

if you'd like to build an rpm installer, then

* compress sources as voc-1.0.src.tar.bz2  
  assuming you in voc directory
> cd ..
> tar -jcvpf voc-1.0.src.tar.bz2 voc
* put them to ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES (on some systems as root to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/) or other similar location.  
> mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES  
> cp voc-1.0.src.tar.bz2 ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES  
* cd to voc directory and run  
> rpmbuild -ba voc.spec

this should create voc rpm installers.
